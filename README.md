## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdftovoice.git
cd pdftovoice
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. On a mobile device, connect to your computer's IP address:
```
http://your-computer-ip:5000
```

4. Use the web interface to:
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Extract text from the PDF
   - Generate audio from the extracted text
   - Play or download the audio file
   
5. Install as a PWA (optional):
   - On desktop: Look for the install icon in your browser's address bar
   - On mobile: Use "Add to Home Screen" in your browser menu

## Mobile Usage

The app is designed to work well on mobile devices. When accessing from a mobile browser, you can install it as a home screen app by:

1. Opening the site in your mobile browser
2. Tapping the browser menu (â‹®)
3. Selecting "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"

This allows you to use the app in fullscreen mode without the browser interface.

## Limitations

- The application works best with PDFs that have properly formatted text
- Very large PDF files may take longer to process
- There is a character limit for the Google Text-to-Speech API (approximately 5000 characters per request)
- The app doesn't handle scanned PDFs that don't have searchable text
